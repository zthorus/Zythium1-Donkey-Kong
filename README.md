# Zythium1-Donkey-Kong
Donkey-Kong game for the Zythium-1 micro-computer 

This is a simple Donkey-Kong game written in Forth for the Zythium-1 (ZTH1 RISC CPU based) micro-computer. It was intended as a test of the ZTH1 Forth cross-compiler. Along with the source code, the mif files (object code) is provided.

This game has only one level (the classic first level) and requires a joystick (plugged on the Arduino port of the Maximator FPGA board on which the Zythium-1 computer has to be synthesized). Since the fire button cannot be used on the Zythium-1, push the joystick up to jump (to dodge the barrels) and to climb a ladder (if Mario is at the bottom of a ladder).
